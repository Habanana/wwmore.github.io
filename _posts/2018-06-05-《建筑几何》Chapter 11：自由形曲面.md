### Bezier Surfaces

## Translational Bézier surfaces.
> - Each boundary polygon of the control mesh defines a Bézier curve that is a boundary curve of the designed Bézier surface patch. Bezier曲面的边界是Bezier曲线.
> - The boundary polygons are the only row and column polygons that define curves on the surface. 内部控制多边形生成的Bezier曲线，不一定在曲面上，除非是translational bezier 曲面:

## Bézier surfaces of degree (1,1)
> -  $r_0 = (1 – v)b_{00} + v b_{01} $
> - $r_1 = (1 – v)b_{10} + vb_{11}$
> - $b(u,v) = (1 – u)(1 – v)b_{00} + (1 – u)vb_{01} + u(1 – v)b_{10} + uvb_{11}$
> - This shows that the surface is (part of ) a hyperbolic paraboloid (or part of a plane if the control quad is planar).

## Bézier surfaces that are also ruled surfaces.
> Consider a Bézier surface of degree $(1,n)$. Its u-curves are Bézier curves of degree 1 and therefore straight line segments. Therefore, this surface is a ruled surface—spanning two Bézier curves of degree $n$.

### B-spline surfaces and NURBS Surfaces

> - Open mode for u- and v-curves: the surface is a four-sided patch.
> - Closed mode in one direction (u or v), open mode in the other direction:
such a surface looks like a deformed piece of a pipe.
> - Closed mode in both directions: the surface looks like a deformed torus.

## Interpolating spline surfaces:
> This interpolation problem in its most general form is difficult to solve. However, the following solution is easy and is implemented in most 3D modelers: Given a set of points, arranged like the control points in a quadrilateral mesh, pass a B-spline surface through it.

### Meshes
> - Roughly speaking, a **mesh** is a collection of points (vertices) arranged into basic elements called **faces. 
> - The faces are bounded by polygons. Typically, one type of polygon dominates (e.g., triangle, quadrilateral, or even hexagon).
