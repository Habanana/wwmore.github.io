## Mathematical description.
> $x(u,v) = x(v)·cos u$, \\
> $y(u,v) = x(v)·sin u$, \\
> $z(u,v) = z(v).$\\
We call this the **standard representation of a rotational surface.**

## Special rotational surfaces.
> - A cylinder is generated when we rotate a straight line parallel to the axis.
> - A straight line that intersects the rotational axis A generates a cone when we rotate it about A. The intersection point becomes the apex v of the cone.
> - Rotating a circle c about any of its diameters produces a sphere.
> - We generate a torus by rotating a circle c about an arbitrary line. This straight line has to lie in the supporting plane of the circle c. Depending on the number of intersection points of c and the rotational axis, we obtain three different types of tori.
> - Torus: \\
`x(u,v) = (s + r · cos v)·cos u`, \\
`y(u,v) = (s + r · cos v)·sin u`, \\
`z(u,v) = r · sin v.`

## Rotational quadrics.
> • Oblate rotational ellipsoid: x2/a2 + y2/a2 + z2/c2 = 1 (a2 > c2)\\
> • Prolate rotational ellipsoid: x2/a2 + y2/a2 + z2/c2 = 1 (a2 < c2)\\
> • Two-sheet rotational hyperboloid: x2/a2 + y2/a2 – z2/c2 = –1\\
> • One-sheet rotational hyperboloid: x2/a2 + y2/a2 – z2/c2 = +1\\
> • Rotational paraboloid: z = a·(x2 + y2)

### Translational surfaces 平移曲面

## Hyperbolic paraboloid.
> - A hyperbolic paraboloid carries exclusively hyperbolic points.
> - Every part of this surface is saddle shaped.
> - The fact that every tangent plane intersects the surface along a pair of different lines implies that the hyperbolic paraboloid carries two sets of lines.
> - The hyperbolic paraboloid is another example of a ruled surface.
> - The name of the hyperbolic paraboloid is sometimes shortened to HP surface.

### Ruled surfaces 直纹面
> - **Cylinders, cones, one-sheet hyperboloids, and hyperbolic paraboloids** are surfaces that carry families of straight lines.
> - The class of all surfaces generated by a moving straight line are called **ruled surfaces**.

## Conoid.
> - Conoids can be generated by moving a straight line segment along a linear directrix c1.
> `x(u,v) = v·cos(f(u)),`\\
> `y(u,v) = v·sin(g(u)),`\\
> `z(u,v) = u.`
> - For identical linear functions f(u) = g(u) = a⋅u + b common helicoids are generated.

## Möbius strip.
>  A parametric representation of a Möbius strip:\\
`x(u,v) = r⋅cos(u) + v⋅cos(u/2)·cos(u),`\\
`y(u,v) = r⋅sin(u) + v⋅cos(u/2)·sin(u)`,\\
 `z(u,v) = v⋅sin(u/2)`.
<img src="/images/posts/AG/mobius strip.png" height="400" width="800">

## HP Surfaces.
> - `x = (1 – v)⋅p + v·q = (1 – v)·[(1 – u)·a + u·b] + v·[(1 – u)·d + u·c].`
> - `x(u,v) = (1 – v)·(1 – u)·a + (1 – v)·u·b + v·(1 – u)·d + v·u·c.`
<img src="/images/posts/AG/HP archi.png" height="320" width="415">
> - They are sometimes called **double ruled surfaces.**
> - The HP surfaces and the one-sheet hyperboloids are the only types of double ruled surfaces.
> - In contrast to the one-sheet hyperboloid, all rulings of an HP surface that belong to the same family are **parallel to a director plane.**
> -  An HP surface has two different families of director planes according to the two families of rulings.

## Plücker’s conoid.

## Tangent planes of ruled surfaces.
> - Ruled surfaces (such as cylinders and cones) contain rulings where the tangent plane touches the surface along the entire line. Such rulings are called **torsal generators**, to distinguish them from the common case of the **non-torsal generators**:
<img src="/images/posts/AG/torsal.png" height="320" width="400">
> - Ruled surfaces with exclusively torsal generators are called **developable surfaces**;
> - Ruled surfaces consisting largely of non-torsal generators are called **skew ruled surfaces** (or warped ruled surfaces).
> - Cylinders, cones, and ruled surfaces that consist of tangents of a spatial curve are developable surfaces.
