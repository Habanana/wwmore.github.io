### Offsets
> From the geometric point of view, a surface has no thickness. However, in architecture one often builds with shells. Thus, we need to give our surface model a certain thickness to make it more realistic. 几何角度曲面没有厚度，为了实现出来，需要增加厚度，则需要考虑等距面。

### Offsets curves 等距线

> - An offset has the same curve normals as the original curve, and thus the corresponding tangents of c and cd in corresponding points are parallel.
> - Offset curves are sometimes referred to as parallel curves.
> -  Offsets can be obtained as envelopes of circles with radius d centered at the curve c.

## Computing offset curves.
> - `c(t) = (x(t), y(t))`,
> - `$n(t)= \frac{(−y'(t),x'(t))}{ \sqrt{x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2}}$`,
> - `c_d(t) = c(t) ± d⋅n(t).`

## Curve, offset, and evolute.
> - The normals of $c$ and $cd$ are the tangents of the evolute $e$.
> - At a cusp, the offset curve meets the evolute orthogonally.

## Offsets of planar polygons.
> - Thus, one branch of the offset $p_d$ at constant distance $d$ consists of line segments (corresponding to the edges of p) and circular arcs (corresponding to the vertices of $p$).
