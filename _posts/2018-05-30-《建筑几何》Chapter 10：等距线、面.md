### Offsets
> From the geometric point of view, a surface has no thickness. However, in architecture one often builds with shells. Thus, we need to give our surface model a certain thickness to make it more realistic. 几何角度曲面没有厚度，为了实现出来，需要增加厚度，则需要考虑等距面。

### Offsets curves 等距线

> - An offset has the same curve normals as the original curve, and thus the corresponding tangents of c and cd in corresponding points are parallel.
> - Offset curves are sometimes referred to as parallel curves.
> -  Offsets can be obtained as envelopes of circles with radius d centered at the curve c.

## Computing offset curves.
> - `c(t) = (x(t), y(t))`,
> - `$n(t)= (−y'(t),x'(t))/ (\sqrt{)x'(t)^2 + y'(t)^2^{1/2}$`,
> - `c_d(t) = c(t) ± d⋅n(t).`

## Curve, offset, and evolute.
> - The normals of $c$ and $cd$ are the tangents of the evolute $e$.
> - At a cusp, the offset curve meets the evolute orthogonally.

## Offsets of planar polygons.
> - Thus, one branch of the offset $p_d$ at constant distance $d$ consists of line segments (corresponding to the edges of p) and circular arcs (corresponding to the vertices of $p$).

### Offsets surfaces 等距面
> - `S(u,v) = (x(u,v), y(u,v), z(u,v))`
> -  `$S_d(u,v) = S(u,v) ± d · n(u,v).$`
> - Only special surface classes have the property that their offsets are again of the same surface type. These include **cylinders** and **rotational surfaces**. 
> - The offsets of the sphere are again spheres, and thus the offsets of a torus are again tori with the same axis and the same middle circle.

## Offsets of polyhedral surfaces.
> - The offset surface Sd of a hyperbolic paraboloid S is no longer a hyperbolic paraboloid.

### Trimming of offsets 修剪等距

> - Thus, for practical applications one sometimes needs to remove these parts of the offset curve.
> - By **local trimming** we remove parts of the offset that overlap because the offset curve intersects the evolute of the original curve.
> -  **Global trimming** is necessary to remove parts of the initial offset curve that overlap but result from distinct regions of the original curve.
